My first exposure to Godzilla came from watching re-runs of the adorable yet absolutely cringe-worthy Hanna-Barbera animated series as a child. But Godzilla represents far more than the child-friendly hero of the cartoon I fondly remember. Godzilla is an international film icon and his appeal goes beyond audiences' appetite for destruction.",

While we prefer to think of art as a reflection of our culture that mirrors our higher selves and it frequently is art can also serve as a dividing line. Without access to the education needed to pry open the class codes woven into the cannon of Western European art, it can be impenetrable. And without the economic mobility that allows us to visit the great galleries of the world, or the leisure time to go to a museum just a few train stops away, art can easily exceed our reach.",

Eastman in 1853, it's called Fast man's directory and lovers' guide to the ladies of fashion and houses of pleasure in New-York and other large cities.

I recall that high end courtesans and prostitutes in England were called \"fashionable impures\" in the early nineteenth century, but didn't know about this American usage. Does anyone know the story behind this label and how long it lasted?",

This year, I made a New Year's resolution to blog more regularly. To get started, I thought I would pick a \"Spencer Collection Book of the Month\" at the beginning of each month and write a short post about it just enough to share with my readers some of the things that make it special, because the Spencer Collection is a Special Collection at the New York Public Library, and so all of our books are special.",
