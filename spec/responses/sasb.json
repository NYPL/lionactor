He was also a New Yorker, and when he embarked on The American Woods, he turned to the trees of his state first in what would eventually grow to be a 14-volume masterwork. The American Woods remains invaluable today due to the range and age of the tree samples Hough included, and the Library's Rare Book Division holds a complete set of this delicate and beautiful work, as part of its George Arents Collection.",

Eastman in 1853, it's called Fast man's directory and lovers' guide to the ladies of fashion and houses of pleasure in New-York and other large cities. What strikes me is the understanding that \"ladies of fashion\" is a term for prostitutes. I didn't know that! I recall that high end courtesans and prostitutes in England were called \"fashionable impures\" in the early nineteenth century, but didn't know about this American usage. Does anyone know the story behind this label and how long it lasted?",
